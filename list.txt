"The Caliber of People"
This is the start of the Broken Angels thread.
Story Date: Friday, August 15, 2015
Timeline note: the content suggests it can't all have happened during one day, what with
looking around, buying properties, hiring several sets of day workers, and doing a good
bit of work on and in the house (including painting, which usually requires drying time).
However, much of that is only mentioned briefly, so might be counted more as backstory,
with the story date applying to the larger part of the story, where the twins join up?

"Mending a Broken System" by dialecticdreamer
Story Date: Friday, December 4, 2015
After "Broken Promises" because Graham mentions Lolly's stuff is at Mister Maxwell's.
Before "It's Raining Buckets..." because Keone there already knows about the name change and
other fraud stuff that he asks Graham about here.
Partially concurrent with "Keeping Score" because both have things happening when stores are
near to closing, but in the last part the Campanellis seem to be offering a room to Lolly,
which wouldn't happen until after "Keeping Score".

"Growing Skills" by dialecticdreamer 3-28-20
Story Date: Thursday, December 17, 2015
I'm not sure if this comes before or after "Origins" as there's not much to go on. However,
it seems more likely to me that Heron would visit early, and Bennett late, than vice versa.
Part 4 mentions Edison wanting to meet with Boss Blaster formally, in the past tense.
This suggests that the story where he does so happens before this one does.

“Controlling a Fight” by dialecticdreamer 1-18-20
Simon+Tolliver teaches the sex workers how to fall, with an interruption.
Using safety mats, in a park of mostly grass - not much else in the way of direct hints for timing.

“Spring Break” by dialecticdreamer 2-2-20
Spring, probably 2016 (can't be earlier), on a Wednesday, during their spring break.
L-Lincoln public schools apparently have Spring Break around the second week of March?
I suppose that could be different in T-Lincoln though.
A comment by DD said that by the time spring break hits, they're at the six month mark
for potlucks at the park; first was nov 25, 2015, 6 months later is may 25, 2016.
That doesn't really match up...

“Play Date” by dialecticdreamer 3-26-20
Summary: Edison asks Boss Blaster for formal permission to visit regularly.
Before Edison and Hali begin playing together regularly. (Not sure if we've seen this happen.)
Must be after "Engine Noise" (Nov 14) since that's where they first do tech stuff together.
I think this must be before "Growing Skills" (Dec 17) since that mentions this in past tense.
