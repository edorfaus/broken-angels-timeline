"Play Date" by dialecticdreamer
Summary: Edison asks Boss Blaster for formal permission to visit regularly.
Before Edison and Hali begin playing together regularly. (Not sure if we've seen this happen.)
After "Engine Noise" (Nov 14) since that's where they first do tech stuff together.
After "Handshake Deal" (Nov 22) since that's where Blaster learns about the lead pipes,
and Edison here mentions that the city government haven't fixed the water pipes.
I think this must be before "Growing Skills" (Dec 17) since that mentions this in past tense.
I think this is before "Ice Cream and Ocean Waves", since Edison is there coming for a date alone
(except for Whirlwind who 'ported him), which I think is _probably_ before "Pastafarian Potluck".

Blaster gets call, talks to Cas about it, then Edison+Bethan arrive
Blaster asks Cas to prep refreshments while they're gone
They drive to a race track
Edison+Blaster play around with the engine, while Bethan drives around the track
--
I'd guess this all takes at least one hour, more likely several, before they're back.
--
Cas has met Edison before, suggests he and Blaster have met up several times to work on
Blaster's SUV engine, but it _might_ have been referring to just that one time in "Engine Noise"
even though that doesn't really sound like quite the same thing (might have been after the story)
--
Active characters: Boss Blaster, Edison, Bethan
Cas is also there/busy for part of it, though less so

Possible dates, and what other stories might stop it from being at each date:

 Tu 24
 We 25 : "Welcome, Mister Maxwell", "Giveaway Games", "Whatâ€™s In a Name?" : first park giveaway, ++
 Th 26
 Fr 27
 Sa 28

 We 16 : "Pastafarian Potluck" : third park giveaway, with Finn visitors, including Edison
 Th 17 : "Growing Skills" : Heron visits Jewel, Edison's formal meeting is mentioned in past tense
I also think "Play Dates for Everyone" is somewhere in here between December 13th and 18th
----
So, if we assume it's on a day that nothing else happens with the Broken Angels, that
eliminates 14 possible dates (plus the 2 end dates), leaving only 10 options.
Some of those 14 dates don't really fill the day, though, so they might still be used.
